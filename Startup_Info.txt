How to make a script run on start up:
  1. On the root user, run the command 'sudo raspi-config'
  2. choose 'Boot Options' -> 'Desktop/CLI' -> 'Console Autologin' then exit this menu.
      - this will mean you do not need to login to start the script. 
  3. run 'sudo nano /etc/profile'
  4. go to the bottom of the file and add the line: 'sudo python [PATH TO PYTHON SCRIPT]' to this file. 
     right now, this is set to 'sudo python /home/pi/Desktop/x.py' 
      - this file is the script that will run when the pi starts up. by adding this line, then we are telling to pi to start the
        python script right after finishing all the boot commands.
